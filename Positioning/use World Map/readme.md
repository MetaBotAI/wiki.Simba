>Regarding reflection vs color, of course reflection is the quicker, easier, and more reliable method to reach the 'goal' of a script for OSRS. Color scripting takes much more time to learn and requires a lot more creativity and effort for many things that are trivial with reflection. But that creative challenge is the biggest appeal of color, personally. Could just be me, but the process of writing the script and solving unique problems is much more satisfying than getting free pixels in some game.
